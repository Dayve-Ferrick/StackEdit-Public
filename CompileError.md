The error message "Compile error: Wrong number of arguments or invalid property assignment" in Excel VBA typically occurs when a function or property is being used incorrectly. This can happen when the number of arguments provided to a function does not match the expected number, or when an assignment is made to a property that does not support it.

In the code shown in the screenshot, the error seems to be related to setting the `.Formula1` property of a `FormatCondition` object. This property expects a single string that represents the formula to be used for the condition without the leading equals sign (`=`).

There may be several reasons for this error:

1. **Misconstructed Formula**: The formula string may be incorrectly constructed, with missing or extra quotes, or incorrect concatenation which can cause the VBA compiler to misinterpret the intended arguments.
   
2. **Incorrect Usage of Property**: If the `.Formula1` property is not expecting a formula in the way it's being constructed, this could also trigger the error. For instance, if there are syntax errors within the formula string or it's not a valid Excel formula.
   
3. **Extra Characters**: Sometimes, hidden characters or typos may cause this error. Itâ€™s essential to ensure that the formula string is clean and contains no extra characters other than those necessary for the formula itself.

Looking at the line that's highlighted:

```vba
fc.Formula1 = "=""AND("" & ColRef & ""<1"",OR("" & ColRef & ""<2"","" $D1<>""))"
```

The construction of the formula string seems complex and there might be a mismatch in the quotes or a logical error within the formula construction. It's also worth checking if `ColRef` contains the expected string value and if the spaces, particularly before `$D1`, are intentional and formatted correctly.

To resolve this, ensure that the formula string passed to `.Formula1` is a valid Excel formula and that it is constructed correctly within the VBA string context. This often involves correctly escaping quotes and concatenating strings in a way that produces a valid result when evaluated by Excel.
